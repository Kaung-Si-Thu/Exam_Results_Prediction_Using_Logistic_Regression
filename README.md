# Exam_Results_Prediction_Using_Logistic_Regression

This project explores the factors that influence student exam performance and builds a predictive model using logistic regression. The dataset includes variables such as study time, parental education, past failures, and other socioeconomic and academic factors.

The objective is to:

Analyze the impact of different factors on exam outcomes.

Build and evaluate a logistic regression model to predict whether a student will pass or fail.

Gain insights that can help educators and policymakers support student success.

The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing (features engineering), model building, evaluation (accuracy), and interpretation of model results.
